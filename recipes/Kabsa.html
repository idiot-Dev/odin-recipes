    <p>Al kabsa was the first Arabic dish I ever made. It turned out extremely delicious and is a new favorite. 
        Serve with fresh mixed cucumber, carrot, lettuce, and tomato 
        salad — preferably with a little lime vinaigrette. Some fresh pita bread on the side would also be nice. 
        Saudis like their kabsa with a hot 
        sauce called shattah</p>

            <li>1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes, undrained</li>
            <li>3 carrots, peeled and grated</li>
            <li>2 whole cloves</li>
            <li>1 pinch ground nutmeg</li>
            <li>1 pinch ground cumin</li>

            <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>3 ¼ cups hot water, plus more if needed</li>
            <li>1 cube chicken bouillon</li>
            <li>2 ¼ cups unrinsed basmati rice</li>
            <li>¼ cup raisins</li>
            <li>¼ cup toasted slivered almonds</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Make spice mix: Stir together 
                saffron, cinnamon, allspice, lime powder, cardamom, 
                and white pepper in a small bowl; set aside.</li>
            <li>Make dish: Melt butter in a large stockpot or 
                Dutch oven over medium heat. Cook and stir onion 
                and garlic in butter until onion has softened and 
                turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Add chicken 
                and cook over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, 
                until lightly browned, about 10 minutes. Mix in tomato purée.</li>
            <li>Stir in canned tomatoes with juice, carrots, cloves, 
                nutmeg, cumin, coriander, salt, black pepper, and reserved spice mix. 
                Cook for about 3 minutes; pour in water and add chicken bouillon cube.</li>
            <li>Bring sauce to a boil, then reduce heat, and cover the pot. 
                Simmer until chicken is no longer pink and the juices run clear, about 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Gently stir in rice. Cover the pot and simmer 
                until rice is tender and almost dry, about 25 minutes; 
                add raisins and a little more hot water, if necessary. 
                Cover and cook until rice grains separate, 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Transfer rice to a large serving 
                platter and arrange chicken on top. 
                Sprinkle with toasted slivered almonds.</li>
        </ol>
